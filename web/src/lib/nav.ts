/**
 * The explorer's left sidebar, from one list: groups of items. The sidebar (components/SidebarNav.tsx), the mobile drawer
 * and the page title in the header all read this and nothing else.
 *
 * Adding a page = one line in the group it belongs to (and its route in main.tsx; nav.test.ts fails when the two disagree).
 *
 * Where the pages other branches add go:
 *   - Fleet server pages (/servers/:jobId): not nav items. They already light up Fleet through its `also: ["/servers"]`,
 *     so just add the route in main.tsx. Another detail page under a nav item: add its path prefix to that item's `also`.
 *   - A page that is deliberately in no menu: add it to HIDDEN_ROUTES below, with the reason.
 * A new group is one more object in NAV_GROUPS (a stable `id`: the open / closed state is remembered per id).

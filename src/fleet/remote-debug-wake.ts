/**
 * Plans/25 "Instant wake": a watched server learns it is watched from its next heartbeat reply (`rd: 1`, up to 30 s
 * away). When a watch STARTS for a job that isn't polling, this publishes a tiny unsigned wake through Roblox Open Cloud
 * Messaging instead, so the kernel (0.5.1+) starts its debug poll within a second:
 *
 *   POST https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/universes/<TYPETORCH_UNIVERSE_ID>:publishMessage
 *   x-api-key: <TYPETORCH_MESSAGING_KEY>
 *   { "topic": "TypeTorch/deploy", "message": "{\"k\":\"rd\",\"j\":\"<JobId>\"}" }
 *
 * The topic: TypeTorch/deploy, the kernel's control topic. Every kernel holds that subscription for its life and it
 * already carries unsigned control messages told apart by `k` (the settings ping) and `rc` (the peers' ask), so no
 * server subscribes to anything new (Roblox allows 20 + 8 x players subscriptions a server). Kernels before 0.5.1
 * ignore a `k` message they don't know (no branch, not a deploy); the rekey topic was not used because older kernels
 * read ANY message there as a key rotation hint (every server would re-read the key asset).
 *
 * Trust: the wake is a hint, never a command. The woken kernel's first poll asks this backend, which says whether the
 * job is really watched, so a forged wake (anyone who can publish to the universe) costs that server one poll.
 *
 * The key: an Open Cloud API key with ONLY universe-messaging-service:publish for this universe. It goes into the
 * x-api-key header and nowhere else: never logged, never in an error line (scrubbed), never in a response.
 *
 * Limits: one wake per job per WAKE_JOB_GAP_MS (the kernel acts on one per 10 s too) and WAKE_PER_MINUTE in all. Every
 * server receives every wake, and Roblox allows (40 + 80 x servers) messages a minute per topic and (400 + 200 x
 * servers) for the whole game, shared with the in-engine MessagingService: 10 a minute stays well under both. A
 * failure is logged and changes nothing else: the watch stands and the heartbeat reply still wakes the server.

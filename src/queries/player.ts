/**
 * One player's numbers over a window, for the explorer's player detail (Players page): spending, playtime and sessions
 * per bucket, the totals, each session and each purchase. Buckets follow the window like the explorer's other charts: up
 * to an hour per minute, up to 6 hours per 5 minutes, up to a day per hour ("today", one custom date), longer per UTC day;
 * the series is dense (empty buckets are zeros). The window is the
 * filter range, cut to the last 400 days (`window.clamped` says so).
 *
 * A session counts in the bucket where it starts, with its whole length (first to last event, like every other query).
 * Spending counts server-sent `purchase` rows only (SERVER_PURCHASE), like the revenue queries.
